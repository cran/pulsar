pulsar 0.3.0 (02-2018 Release)
==============

Changes:

* Migrate to the new and improved batchtools for batch.pulsar & related functions. BatchJobs is deprecated.
** Updated how default config files and templates are sourced
** Removed the getTempDir function
** Updated documentation
** Deprecated batch.pulsar progressbar arguments, now controlled by batchtools options.

* Fixed some failing tests. Small data tests were too sensitive to parameter choices, substituted larger p datasets.
* Similar fix for problem vignettes.
